I don't use Spotify, but I still wanted to share my music recap for the year in a format like Spotify's Wrapped, so I decided to recreate the #Wrapped2020 layout using SwiftUI

This app doesn't connect to Spotify or any other service, it just displays a mocked data in a visual similar to this year Spotify's Wrapped.
